## Attribute
I can’t give the exact resources where I got some parts of the code from or read about them and found out how it works, because I found all the information in various open resources, the main resource is [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), unfortunately I cannot find other resources, there were very, very many of them.
For example, the blog [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_forms.asp) also helped me a lot in creating “submit_form.php”, but there were other sources besides it that I can’t find.

Also, to create the "Video Autoplayer" using PHP language which is located on the "Home" page at the very bottom, I used information from various open resources, such as [Mdn API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Video_and_audio_APIs) and [YouTube Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference).
